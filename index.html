        <p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on teaching language models how to reason, particularly in medical, law, and science domains. We encourage submissions that discuss novel techniques, approaches, and innovative ideas related to this topic. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teaching reasoning through knowledge distillation</li>
            <li>Incorporating logic and reasoning capabilities in language models</li>
            <li>Chain of thought prompting and reasoning in smaller language models</li>
            <li>Integrating self-explanation techniques for reasoning in LMs</li>
            <li>Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of language models</li>
            <li>Applications of reasoning in specific domains such as medical, law, and science</li>
            <li>Ethics and limitations of reasoning capabilities in language models</li>
        </ul>
