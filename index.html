        <h2>Workshop Description</h2>
        <p>Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence as it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more data. Despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to pin down to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.</p>
        <p>The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives, to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and using logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analyzing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalizing the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are a key requirement.</p>
        <p>Format: A combination of invited talks from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives, submitted papers with oral and poster presentations, and panel discussions. This format will foster a dynamic exchange of ideas, encourage in-depth dialogue among participants, and highlight the latest advancements in the field.</p>
        <p>Expected activities: Invited talks from leading researchers, presentations of selected papers, poster sessions for additional papers and/or demonstrations, accompanied by interactive panel discussions to further promote networking and collaboration.</p>

        <p>Planned or confirmed invited speakers: To be determined.</p>

        <h2>Related Events</h2>
        <p>History of the workshop: This is the first edition of NeLaMKRR.</p>
        <p>Relationship to recent similar events: Despite no similar workshops solely focused on teaching language models to reason, there are recent research developments and publications in this area, such as Amazon's outstanding paper award at ACL 2021, the Orca 2 language model, and various research papers on the topic. One of the invited talks at KR2024 (by Subbarao Kambhampati) is closely related to the topic of the workshop. There will be a related workshop at ACL2024 (KaLLM: Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models, https://kallmworkshop.github.io/kallm2024/) focusing specifically on reasoning with knowledge graph. While this is an envisaged topic of TMLR, its scope is much broader. There will also be a related workshop (Towards Knowledgeable Language Models, https://knowledgeable-lm.github.io/) at ACL2024, focused however on extracting knowledge from language models rather than reasoning. Thus, these parallel events will be complementary to NeLaMKRR.</p>
