        <h1>Workshop Proposal: Teaching Language Models to Reason (TLMR)</h1>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Teaching Language Models to Reason (TLMR)</p>
        <p><strong>Acronym:</strong> TLMR</p>
        <p><strong>Proposed duration:</strong> One day</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Workshop Description:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Goals: To create a platform for researchers and experts to discuss approaches and techniques to teach language models (LMs) how to reason, particularly in domains where logic plays a crucial role, such as in medical, law, and science fields.</li>
            <li>Format: A combination of invited talks, submitted papers with oral and poster presentations, and panel discussions.</li>
            <li>Expected activities: Invited talks from leading researchers, presentations of selected papers, poster sessions for additional papers, and interactive panel discussions to promote networking and collaboration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Audience:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Target audience: Researchers and professionals specializing in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning, with a particular focus on those working on logic-heavy fields such as medical, law, and science.</li>
            <li>Research groups: Active research groups in the area of natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and related fields.</li>
            <li>Planned or confirmed invited speakers: To be determined.</li>
            <li>Expected number of submissions and participants: Approximately 15-20 paper submissions and 50-100 participants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Related events:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>History of the workshop: This is the first edition of TLMR.</li>
            <li>Relationship to recent similar events: Despite no similar workshops solely focused on teaching language models to reason, there are recent research developments and publications in this area, such as Amazon's outstanding paper award at ACL 2021, the Orca 2 language model, and various research papers on the topic.</li>

        <p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on teaching language models how to reason, particularly in medical, law, and science domains. We encourage submissions that discuss novel techniques, approaches, and innovative ideas related to this topic. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teaching reasoning through knowledge distillation</li>
            <li>Incorporating logic and reasoning capabilities in language models</li>
            <li>Chain of thought prompting and reasoning in smaller language models</li>
            <li>Integrating self-explanation techniques for reasoning in LMs</li>
            <li>Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of language models</li>
            <li>Applications of reasoning in specific domains such as medical, law, and science</li>
            <li>Ethics and limitations of reasoning capabilities in language models</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submission Details:</h3>
        <p>Contributions may be regular papers (up to 9 pages) or position papers (up to 5 pages), including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements.
